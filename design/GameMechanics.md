# Game Mechanics Document
This document describes the game mechanics of JDungeon3D.


## Movement
The player has the freedom to move seamlessly throughout the open world using a combination of the WSAD keys and the mouse. Specifically, the controls are as follows:

* W: Move forward
* S: Move backward
* A: Strafe left
* D: Strafe right

Additionally, the mouse is used to rotate the character, allowing the player to explore and view their surroundings with ease. This control scheme ensures an intuitive and immersive experience as the player navigates through the game world.

To define the boundaries of the game world, certain areas are restricted. The player is not allowed to swim; water bodies will serve as natural boundaries that the player cannot cross. Furthermore, steep hills and cliffs will be used strategically to limit access to specific regions, guiding the playerâ€™s exploration and progression within the game world.
