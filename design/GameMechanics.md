# Game Mechanics Document
This document describes the game mechanics of JDungeon3D.

This is a document is not final yet and open for suggestions and improvements. If you feel like adding/changing something have a look at the CONTRIBUTING.MD file.

## Movement
The player has the freedom to move seamlessly throughout the open world.

To define the boundaries of the game world, certain areas are restricted. The player is not allowed to swim in the sea as it will serve as a natural boundary that the player cannot cross. Furthermore, steep hills and cliffs will be used strategically to limit access to specific regions, guiding the playerâ€™s exploration and progression within the game world.

## Controls   
    
Movement works trough standard directional inputs. A WASD scheme by default.
* **W**: Move forward
* **S**: Move backward
* **A**: Strafe left
* **D**: Strafe right

### Mouse cursor and camera movement:
The game allows independent movement of the mouse cursor as a way to select things in the world and to move the camera.
* When moving the camera the cursor is considered to be in the center of the screen, allowing you to "aim" at objects with the camera to select them. This makes it impossible to move the cursor towards HUD elements and is reliant on key binds. 
* When moving the cursor, the camera remains stationary. But you can select anything within your field of view.  
  
  A button can be used to temporarily invert the behavior. By default, the mouse moves the camera.

    
## Combat
Within the world of JDungeon, players will encounter various enemies. These enemies are entities that can be targeted and fought against. Defeating enemies will reward players with experience points and potential rewards in the form of loot or quest progression.

### Targeting and Engaging Enemies
* **Targeting:** Left-clicking on an enemy under your cursor marks them as your current target.
* **Engaging Combat:** If the auto-attack option is selected, you'll automatically attack your enemy when it is within range and you're not busy performing a different action. Otherwise, you must press or hold the dedicated attack button to toggle/maintain your basic attack.

### Challenging Enemies and Rewards
JDungeon's main focus is to present players with challenging enemies. The difficulty of enemies varies, and defeating stronger enemies will yield higher rewards. These rewards can include more experience points, better loot, and significant progress in quests. This encourages players to develop their skills and strategies to overcome tougher adversaries for greater benefits.
#### Enemy Type Philosophies
* **Swarm:** Very weak enemies that only pose a threat in groups. Their health is minimal, but their combined attack when swarmed can surpass a normal or elite enemy. 
* **Grunt:** The typical base-line foe. Trivial for non-new players, but by no means harmless.
* **Elite:** Exceptionally strong foes and the most damaging available. But low enough health to be beaten quickly. Elites are something that not even experienced players should take lightly.
* **Boss:** Huge health pools and dangerous attacks. Bosses cannot be mobbed like other types can, instead providing a more drawn out combat experience.

## Skills
In JDungeon, players have the opportunity to obtain and utilize various skills. These skills can enhance a player's abilities in combat, providing clever tools to gain the upper hand and secure victory.

### Obtaining Skills
Skills can be acquired by performing certain activities, including combat. This ensures that players are rewarded for their efforts and progress within the game. Each activity has its own pool of skills that the player can choose from as they perform said activities, but different pools may have overlapping skills.

### Types of Skills
There are different types of skills available to players:

* **Instant Skills:** These skills activate instantly with an immediate effect.
* **Active Skills:** These have a brief time after activation that prevents the user from performing other actions (usually occupied by an animation). Active skills cannot be interrupted even if their animation were to be stopped for any reason.
* **Cast Time Skills:** Upon usage, the player becomes unable to perform other actions, sometimes even becoming unable to move. After a timer, the skill activates. These may be interrupted by other creatures or the user itself.

### Skill Mechanics

* **Targeting:** Skills have different targeting requirements for being activated. Some acquire targets automatically and can be activated at any time (some may require a valid target to be present), while others may require a specific creature to be selected. Additionally, some allow manually aiming at a spot in the ground instead of at creatures.
* **Energy Cost:** Performing a skill may cost energy, which must be managed to ensure the player can continue to use their abilities effectively during combat.
* **Cooldowns:** After using a certain skill, there may be a cooldown period during which the skill cannot be used again. This requires players to strategically plan their skill usage to maximize effectiveness and maintain a tactical advantage in combat.
* **Skill Selection:** Players can only select a limited number of 8 skills for each combat situation. This means that players must choose wisely to ensure they have the correct combination of skills for each specific encounter. Proper skill selection can greatly influence the outcome of a battle, encouraging strategic thinking and preparation. Skills may be changed in any safe zone.

JDungeon's skill system is designed to provide depth and strategy to combat, encouraging players to develop and utilize a variety of skills to overcome challenges and achieve success in the game world.
  
## Stats
Each player in JDungeon has a certain set of base stats: Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Vitality. These stats are fundamental to a player's capabilities in combat and exploration.

### Base Stats
* **Strength:** A measure of a player's physical power, affecting their attack power and melee damage. 
* **Agility:** Determines a player's speed, reflexes, and dexterity, influencing their attack speed, critical hit chance, and evasion.
* **Intellect:** Represents a player's intelligence and magical prowess, affecting their critical hit damage, spell power and magical damage.
* **Vitality:** Measures a player's health and resilience, influencing their maximum health points and overall durability in combat.

### Secondary Stats
These base stats are used to calculate secondary stats, including:
*(Values in parenthesis is how much the values are increased by the named stat)*
* **Attack Power:** Determines the damage dealt by physical attacks. (Strength)
* **Spell Power:** Influences the effectiveness of magical spells and abilities. (Intellect)
* **Defense:** Reduces incoming damage from physical attacks. (Only from armor)
* **Energy:** Some skills consume energy and cannot be used without the required amount, this regenerates over time. (Intellect)
* **Health:** Determines a player's maximum health points. (Strength)
* **Attack Speed:** Increases the speed of most combat animations.
* **Evasion:** Negates damage taken up to the stored amount. Evasion regenerates rapidly up to its maximum and it is reduced by the amount of damage taken. (Agility)
*  **Critical Hit Chance:** The chance of performing a critical hit, applying a multiplier to damage dealt. (Agility) 

### Stat Enhancement
Stats can be increased through various means:

* **Leveling Up:** Gaining stat points while leveling up allows players to increase their base stats according to their preferences.
* **Gear:** Equipping certain gear can provide bonuses to specific stats, enhancing a player's capabilities in combat and exploration.
* **Skills and Consumables:** Certain skills or consumables can temporarily boost a player's stats, providing strategic advantages in battle or during challenging encounters.

## Loot
In JDungeon, each enemy has a possibility to drop a certain type of loot upon defeat. Different types of enemies have distinct sets of items they can drop. Generally, stronger enemies will reward players with higher quality loot. Additionally, some quests will require players to collect specific types of loot. Certain enemies also have the chance to drop gold, adding another layer of reward for defeating foes.

### Loot Mechanics
* **Loot Drops:** Each enemy has a unique loot table, with various items that can be dropped upon their defeat. The rarity and quality of loot generally increase with the difficulty of the enemy.
* **Gold Drops:** Certain enemies can also drop gold, providing players with a valuable resource for purchasing items, equipment, and other necessities in the game.
* **Quest-Related Loot:** Some quests may require players to collect specific items dropped by enemies.

Loot can be picked up by the player who killed the enemy. Once an item is picked up, it is placed in the player's bag, provided there is enough space.

JDungeon's loot system is designed to incentivize players to take on more challenging foes and to engage in various quests, offering a rewarding experience for their efforts and achievements.

## Inventory
The player in JDungeon has an inventory with a maximum capacity of 16 items. These items, gained from loot, trade, or quests, are stored in the inventory and can be used by the player. There are multiple types of items:

* **Equipment:** Items that can be equipped by the player to enhance their abilities or provide protection.
* **Consumables:** Items that provide an instant or temporary boost to the player, such as health potions or buffs.
* **Junk:** Items that have no direct use for the player but can be sold to merchants for gold.

### Inventory Management
* **Capacity Limit:** Once the inventory is full, the player cannot carry any more items. This requires the player to manage their inventory carefully.
* **Item Disposal:** To free up space, the player can drop, sell, or delete items from their inventory. This ensures that players make strategic decisions about which items to keep and which to discard, balancing their needs for combat, exploration, and trade.
* **Trading:** Players can also trade items with other players. This adds a social and strategic layer to inventory management, allowing players to acquire needed items or exchange excess items for valuable resources.

## Equipment
In JDungeon, characters can equip multiple pieces of equipment to enhance their capabilities in combat and exploration. Each piece of equipment provides a boost to the secondary stats of the player and may have specific requirements for wielding.

### Equipment Slots
Players can equip items in various slots, including:
* Armor (Main armor piece covering at least the waist)
* Head (Helmet or any large headgear)
* Arms (Gauntlets, gloves)
* Legs (Boots, shin-guards, footwear)
* Accessory 1 (Any miscellaneous addition)
* Accessory 2
* Accessory ...
* Hand (Occupied by the main weapon)
* Offhand (When using one handed weapons, it can hold another weapon/shield. Otherwise it is disabled while the main weapon is equipped.)

### Equipment Management
* **Inventory Interaction:** When unequipping an item, it is placed back into the inventory of the player.
* **Combat Restrictions:** No equipment can be swapped during combat, ensuring that players cannot change their gear mid-battle. This adds a strategic element to combat preparation and encourages players to carefully plan their equipment loadout before engaging in combat.

### Equipment Requirements
Each piece of equipment may have minimum level requirements and/or primary stat requirements to be wielded effectively. For example, a powerful sword may require a minimum strength stat to use, while a magical robe may have a minimum intellect requirement.

### Weapon Types
Weapons can be equipped in the right and left hand slots. Depending on whether a weapon is single-handed or dual-wielded, another weapon or shield can be equipped in the other hand. This allows for diverse combat strategies and playstyles.

## Level system
In JDungeon, players progress through the game by gaining levels, starting at level 1 and reaching a maximum level of 100. To advance to the next level, a player must obtain a certain amount of experience points.

### Experience Gain
Experience points can be obtained by:
* **Defeating Enemies:** Players earn experience by defeating enemies in combat.
* **Completing Quests:** Quest completion also rewards players with experience points.

### Level Advancement
Each new level attained provides the player with a certain amount of stat points. These stat points can be allocated to increase the player's base stats, such as strength, agility, intellect, and vitality. Allocating these points strategically allows players to tailor their characters to their preferred playstyle and strategic preferences.
