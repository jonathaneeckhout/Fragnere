# Game Mechanics Document
This document describes the game mechanics of JDungeon3D.


## Movement
The player has the freedom to move seamlessly throughout the open world using a combination of the WSAD keys and the mouse. Specifically, the controls are as follows:

* **W**: Move forward
* **S**: Move backward
* **A**: Strafe left
* **D**: Strafe right

Additionally, the mouse is used to enhance the player's control over their character and view of the environment:

* **Right Mouse Button:** Holding the right mouse button and moving the mouse rotates the character along with the camera.
* **Left Mouse Button:** Holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse rotates the camera around the character without actually rotating the character itself, providing a flexible and immersive viewing experience.

To define the boundaries of the game world, certain areas are restricted. The player is not allowed to swim; water bodies will serve as natural boundaries that the player cannot cross. Furthermore, steep hills and cliffs will be used strategically to limit access to specific regions, guiding the playerâ€™s exploration and progression within the game world.

## Combat
Within the world of JDungeon, players will encounter various enemies. These enemies are entities that can be targeted and fought against. Defeating enemies will reward players with experience points and potential rewards in the form of loot or quest progression.
Targeting and Engaging Enemies

* **Targeting:** Left-clicking an enemy will target it, making it your primary target.
* **Engaging Combat:** Right-clicking an enemy will trigger your character to engage in combat. If the enemy is within range of your auto-attack skills, the player character will automatically attack the enemy.

Challenging Enemies and Rewards

JDungeon's main focus is to present players with challenging enemies. The difficulty of enemies varies, and defeating stronger enemies will yield higher rewards. These rewards can include more experience points, better loot, and significant progress in quests. This encourages players to develop their skills and strategies to overcome tougher adversaries for greater benefits.

## Skills
In JDungeon, players have the opportunity to obtain and utilize various skills. These skills can enhance a player's abilities in combat, providing clever tools to gain the upper hand and secure victory.
Obtaining Skills

Skills can be acquired through completing certain challenging quests or by defeating difficult foes. This ensures that players are rewarded for their efforts and progress within the game.
Types of Skills

There are different types of skills available to players:

* **Instant Skills:** These skills can be performed instantly on a target, providing immediate effects.
* **Cast Time Skills:** These skills require a casting time, during which the player must remain stationary or perform specific actions to complete the skill.
* **Area Skills:** Certain skills require the player to aim at a specific area using the mouse, allowing for strategic placement and execution.

Skill Mechanics

* **Energy Cost:** Performing a skill may cost energy, which must be managed to ensure the player can continue to use their abilities effectively during combat.
* **Cooldowns:** After using a certain skill, there may be a cooldown period during which the skill cannot be used again. This requires players to strategically plan their skill usage to maximize effectiveness and maintain a tactical advantage in combat.
* **Skill Selection:** Players can only select a limited number of 8 skills for each combat situation. This means that players must choose wisely to ensure they have the correct combination of skills for each specific encounter. Proper skill selection can greatly influence the outcome of a battle, encouraging strategic thinking and preparation.

JDungeon's skill system is designed to provide depth and strategy to combat, encouraging players to develop and utilize a variety of skills to overcome challenges and achieve success in the game world.

Certain enemies also have the chance to drop gold, adding another layer of reward for defeating foes.
Loot Mechanics

* **Loot Drops:** Each enemy has a unique loot table, with various items that can be dropped upon their defeat. The rarity and quality of loot generally increase with the difficulty of the enemy.
* **Gold Drops:** Certain enemies can also drop gold, providing players with a valuable resource for purchasing items, equipment, and other necessities in the game.
* **Quest-Related Loot:** Some quests may require players to collect specific items dropped by enemies.

Loot can be picked up by the player who killed the enemy. Once an item is picked up, it is placed in the player's bag, provided there is enough space.
