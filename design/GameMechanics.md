# Game Mechanics Document
This document describes the game mechanics of JDungeon3D.


## Movement
The player has the freedom to move seamlessly throughout the open world using a combination of the WSAD keys and the mouse. Specifically, the controls are as follows:

* **W**: Move forward
* **S**: Move backward
* **A**: Strafe left
* **D**: Strafe right

Additionally, the mouse is used to enhance the player's control over their character and view of the environment:

* **Right Mouse Button**: Holding the right mouse button and moving the mouse rotates the character along with the camera.
* **Left Mouse Button**: Holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse rotates the camera around the character without actually rotating the character itself, providing a flexible and immersive viewing experience.

To define the boundaries of the game world, certain areas are restricted. The player is not allowed to swim; water bodies will serve as natural boundaries that the player cannot cross. Furthermore, steep hills and cliffs will be used strategically to limit access to specific regions, guiding the playerâ€™s exploration and progression within the game world.
