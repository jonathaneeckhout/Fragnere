# Game Mechanics Document
This document describes the game mechanics of JDungeon3D.


## Movement
The player has the freedom to move seamlessly throughout the open world using a combination of the WSAD keys and the mouse. Specifically, the controls are as follows:

* **W**: Move forward
* **S**: Move backward
* **A**: Strafe left
* **D**: Strafe right

Additionally, the mouse is used to enhance the player's control over their character and view of the environment:

* **Right Mouse Button:** Holding the right mouse button and moving the mouse rotates the character along with the camera.
* **Left Mouse Button:** Holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse rotates the camera around the character without actually rotating the character itself, providing a flexible and immersive viewing experience.

To define the boundaries of the game world, certain areas are restricted. The player is not allowed to swim; water bodies will serve as natural boundaries that the player cannot cross. Furthermore, steep hills and cliffs will be used strategically to limit access to specific regions, guiding the playerâ€™s exploration and progression within the game world.

## Combat
Within the world of JDungeon, players will encounter various enemies. These enemies are entities that can be targeted and fought against. Defeating enemies will reward players with experience points and potential rewards in the form of loot or quest progression.
Targeting and Engaging Enemies

* **Targeting:** Left-clicking an enemy will target it, making it your primary target.
* **Engaging Combat:** Right-clicking an enemy will trigger your character to engage in combat. If the enemy is within range of your auto-attack skills, the player character will automatically attack the enemy.

Challenging Enemies and Rewards

JDungeon's main focus is to present players with challenging enemies. The difficulty of enemies varies, and defeating stronger enemies will yield higher rewards. These rewards can include more experience points, better loot, and significant progress in quests. This encourages players to develop their skills and strategies to overcome tougher adversaries for greater benefits.
