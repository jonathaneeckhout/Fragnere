This approach uses a combination of Entities, Components and Systems to allow modularity and ease of access.

Entities are simple empty nodes in this case, since they have plenty of ways to handle their own identity. Their purpose is simply to contain components.

Components are also nodes, but they automatically register themselves on a variable that is shared among all other instances AND can be accessed statically (without an instance). They should only CONTAIN data and have minimal functionality past that.

Systems is where most of the functionality goes, they act as Singletons and are in charge of communicating components among each other.
